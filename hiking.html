<h2>🥾 Elk Knob State Park (Boone, NC – ~30 minutes away)</h2>
<p>Elk Knob offers a rewarding 4-mile round-trip hike — 2 miles up and 2 miles back down — to one of the highest peaks in the High Country. The trail is rated moderate to strenuous, but it’s wide, well-maintained, and safe for families. You won’t find steep drop-offs or technical sections, making it a great choice for adventurous kids too.</p>
<p><strong>Owner’s Tip:</strong> Pack a lunch and enjoy a picnic at the summit. The panoramic views at the top are absolutely worth the climb, and it's usually not crowded even in peak season.</p>

<h2>💧 Cascade Falls (Blue Ridge Parkway – ~35 minutes away)</h2>
<p>Cascade Falls is a scenic, easy-to-moderate hike that follows a peaceful creek and leads to a beautiful multi-tiered waterfall. The loop trail is well-marked, gently sloped, and perfect for a quick nature walk or a relaxing family outing.</p>
<p><strong>Owner’s Tip:</strong> This is a great Blue Ridge Parkway stop — quick, refreshing, and photo-worthy. Bring a camera and enjoy the sound of the water as you descend to the viewing platforms.</p>
