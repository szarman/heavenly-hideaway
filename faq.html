<h2>Does the cabin have air conditioning?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes, Heavenly Hideaway now has air conditioning. Window AC units are installed in all rooms May-Sept</strong><br/>


<h2>Is four-wheel drive needed in the winter?</h2>
<p><strong>Four-wheel drive is highly recommended during the winter months.</strong><br/>
This recommendation applies not only to reaching Heavenly Hideaway but to most destinations in the surrounding mountain area during snowy or icy conditions.
While you can typically reach the bottom-level garage without four-wheel drive, accessing the upper-level back entrance during snow or ice storms will require it.</p>

<h2>Will the driveway be plowed during snowstorms?</h2>
<p><strong>Yes â€” we have snow removal equipment on-site, and someone will come to plow the driveway.</strong><br/>
Please note that during significant snowstorms, it may take until the following day for plowing to occur, as main roads must be cleared first. 
If heavy snow is in the forecast, we recommend stocking up on a couple daysâ€™ worth of meals in advance to ensure comfort until roads are fully accessible.</p>

<h2>Is firewood provided for the fireplace or firepit?</h2>
<p><strong>No â€” guests should plan to bring their own firewood.</strong><br/>
To keep things simple and sanitary, we do not stock or supply firewood on-site. You can find bundled firewood at nearby gas stations, grocery stores, and hardware stores in Boone or West Jefferson.</p>
<p>We recommend dry, seasoned hardwood for the best burn. Bringing a lighter or fire starter is also helpful.</p>
<p><em>Tip: Ashe County Hardware and Lowes Foods often have firewood bundles near the front entrance.</em></p>
<h2>How is the cell service at the cabin?</h2>
<p><strong>Cell service is generally available, but can be spotty depending on your carrier.</strong><br/>
Guests with Verizon or AT&amp;T typically get a usable signal from the <strong>back porch or driveway</strong> â€” enough for phone calls and texts. That said, coverage can vary due to the mountain setting and occasional tower outages, especially following recent hurricanes.</p>
<p>For added reliability, we provide a <strong>landline phone</strong> in the cabin thatâ€™s available for emergency use.</p>
<p><em>ðŸ“¶ Tip: For best reception, try standing near the railing on the back porch or enable wifi calling</em></p>
<h2>What should we do with trash during our stay?</h2>
<p><strong>Two large trash cans are provided in the garage for household waste.</strong><br/>
Please make sure <strong>all trash placed in the bins is bagged</strong> â€” this helps keep the cabin clean, odor-free, and discourages animals from sniffing around.</p>
<p>These cans are typically sufficient for week long stays. For extended visits, if the bins become full, you can drop off additional bagged trash at the local dump station just 15 minutes away:</p>
<p><strong>Boone Waste Convenience Center</strong><br/>
336 Landfill Rd, Boone, NC 28607<br/>
Open Mondayâ€“Saturday, 7:00 AMâ€“6:00 PM</p>
<p><em>Please do not leave trash outside the cabin, even in bags, as it may attract wildlife.</em></p>
