<h2>How do we get to Heavenly Hideaway?</h2>
<p>The address is: <strong>1481 Willet Miller Rd, Todd, NC</strong></p>
<p>When you arrive, look for a mailbox painted with <strong>"Heavenly Hideaway"</strong> in white. This marks the entrance to the cabin. The driveway is gravel and leads uphill directly to the property.</p>
<p><em>üìç We recommend entering the full address in Google Maps for the most accurate directions.</em></p>

<h2>Does the cabin have air conditioning?</h2>
<p><strong>No, Heavenly Hideaway does not have air conditioning ‚Äî and you likely won‚Äôt miss it.</strong><br/>
Our cabin is perched at 3,200 feet in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where summer temperatures are typically mild. Most days stay in the 60s‚Äì70s, and even the warmest weeks rarely rise above 85¬∞F. Nights cool off quickly, creating ideal conditions for restful sleep.</p>
<p>We provide fans and screened windows to let in the mountain breeze. Guests often comment on how refreshing the natural air feels ‚Äî and how little they missed A/C.</p>
<h2>Is firewood provided for the fireplace or firepit?</h2>
<p><strong>No ‚Äî guests should plan to bring their own firewood.</strong><br/>
To keep things simple and sanitary, we do not stock or supply firewood on-site. You can find bundled firewood at nearby gas stations, grocery stores, and hardware stores in Boone or West Jefferson.</p>
<p>We recommend dry, seasoned hardwood for the best burn. Bringing a lighter or fire starter is also helpful.</p>
<p><em>Tip: Ashe County Hardware and Lowes Foods often have firewood bundles near the front entrance.</em></p>
<h2>How is the cell service at the cabin?</h2>
<p><strong>Cell service is generally available, but can be spotty depending on your carrier.</strong><br/>
Guests with Verizon or AT&amp;T typically get a usable signal from the <strong>back porch or driveway</strong> ‚Äî enough for phone calls and texts. That said, coverage can vary due to the mountain setting and occasional tower outages, especially following recent hurricanes.</p>
<p>For added reliability, we provide a <strong>landline phone</strong> in the cabin that‚Äôs available for emergency use.</p>
<p><em>üì∂ Tip: For best reception, try standing near the railing on the back porch.</em></p>
<h2>What should we do with trash during our stay?</h2>
<p><strong>Two large trash cans are provided in the garage for household waste.</strong><br/>
Please make sure <strong>all trash placed in the bins is bagged</strong> ‚Äî this helps keep the cabin clean, odor-free, and discourages animals from sniffing around.</p>
<p>These cans are typically sufficient for weekend or short stays. For extended visits, if the bins become full, you can drop off additional bagged trash at the local dump station just 15 minutes away:</p>
<p><strong>Boone Waste Convenience Center</strong><br/>
336 Landfill Rd, Boone, NC 28607<br/>
Open Monday‚ÄìSaturday, 7:00 AM‚Äì6:00 PM</p>
<p><em>Please do not leave trash outside the cabin, even in bags, as it may attract wildlife.</em></p>
