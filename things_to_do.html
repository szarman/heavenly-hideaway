    <h2>🚣‍♂️ Water Adventures on the New River</h2>
    <p>There’s nothing more refreshing than a day on the <strong>New River</strong>, especially in the warmer months — and Heavenly Hideaway is just minutes from two of the best outfitters in the High Country.</p>

    <h3>🎣 RiverGirl Fishing Co. (Todd, NC – 5 minutes away)</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.rivergirlfishing.com/" target="_blank">RiverGirl Fishing Co.</a> is a beloved local outfitter offering kayak, tube, and bike rentals in the quaint town of Todd. On hot summer days, floating down the New River in a tube is pure bliss. The route takes you through a peaceful, shaded stretch of the river — perfect for couples, families, and anyone looking to unwind.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Visiting in the spring or fall? Opt for a kayak — the water’s cold, but the views are beautiful.</p>

    <h3>🛶 Zaloo’s Canoes, Kayaks & Tubes (Jefferson, NC – ~20 minutes away)</h3>
    <p><a href="https://zaloos.com/" target="_blank">Zaloo’s</a> provides access to a deeper, wider section of the river. Ideal when water levels are low or you want a new route, this scenic float takes you through farmland and mountain views with calm currents.</p>

    <h3>💡 Owner’s Helpful Hint: DIY Tubing</h3>
    <p>You can purchase cheap inner tubes and a 12V air pump at Walmart. Launch your own float from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/q26F8Zb8WqG2" target="_blank">Green Valley Community Park</a> and float ~1.5–2 hours back to Todd. Use two vehicles: one parked in Todd, and one to shuttle your group to the park. It’s a guest favorite!</p>

    <h2>⛳ Mountain Golfing Near Heavenly Hideaway</h2>

    <h3>🏔️ Mountain Aire Golf Club (West Jefferson, NC – ~20 minutes away)</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.mountainairegolfclub.com/" target="_blank">Mountain Aire</a> is a scenic mountain course with elevation drops, fair but challenging play, and long-range views. It’s the closest course to the cabin and a favorite among locals and guests alike.</p>
    <p><strong>Owner’s Tip:</strong> Rent an extra cart for non-golfers to ride along and enjoy the mountain beauty — it’s like a scenic hike without the walking.</p>

    <h3>🏌️‍♂️ Olde Beau Golf & Country Club (Roaring Gap, NC – ~1 hr 15 min away)</h3>
    <p><a href="https://oldebeauresort.com/golf/" target="_blank">Olde Beau</a> is a pristine, well-manicured mountain golf course that feels like a private club — yet it's affordable and unforgettable. Worth every minute of the 1 hr 15 min drive.</p>
    <p><strong>Owner’s Tip:</strong> Take the Blue Ridge Parkway back via Deep Gap for a scenic end to your golf day.</p>

    <h2>🚴‍♀️ Scenic Biking Adventures</h2>

    <h3>🚲 Todd Railroad Grade Road + Big Hill Rd</h3>
    <p>Rent a bike from <a href="https://www.rivergirlfishing.com/" target="_blank">RiverGirl Fishing Co.</a> and enjoy a peaceful ride down Todd Railroad Grade Road, a mostly flat route that hugs the New River. Cross the bridge for an equally scenic and flat ride along Big Hill Rd — don’t let the name fool you!</p>

    <h3>🚴 Virginia Creeper Trail (Damascus, VA – ~1.5 hours away)</h3>
    <p>This 24-mile downhill ride is a must-do. Rent a bike from <a href="https://thebikestation.net/" target="_blank">The Bike Station</a> in Damascus and take their shuttle to the top. From there, it’s a gentle coast through forests, fields, and bridges back into town. You’ll barely need to pedal.</p>
    <p><strong>Owner’s Tip:</strong> Bring a camera, snacks, and enjoy the most relaxing 24-mile ride you’ll ever experience.</p>
