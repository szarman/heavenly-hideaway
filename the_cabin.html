    <h2>Your Mountain Retreat</h2>
    <p>
        Heavenly Hideaway is a 4-bedroom, 3.5-bath retreat set on 12 private acres at 3,200 feet elevation, surrounded by three peaceful creeks and native hardwood forest. Designed for rest, reconnection, and adventure, this well-appointed cabin balances rustic charm with thoughtful modern comforts. The interior features a cozy great room with a stone fireplace, a fully equipped kitchen with modern appliances, and a spacious dining area for family meals. Every bedroom offers cozy linens and views of the trees, while the master suite includes a private bath and reading nook.

        Step outside to enjoy the large deck, fire pit, and private hot tub under the stars. In every season, the outdoor space delivers peace and natural beauty—whether you’re listening to the creeks flow in spring, grilling out in summer, admiring fall leaves, or warming up after a snowy walk. From here, you’re only minutes from the New River, hiking trails, charming towns, and scenic drives, but you’ll feel miles from everything. Heavenly Hideaway is more than a place to stay—it’s a place to feel at home in the mountains.
