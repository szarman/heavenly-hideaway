    <h2>Your Mountain Retreat</h2>
    <p>Secluded serenity, just minutes from adventure.</p>
    <p>Relax with the whole family at this peaceful place to stay.</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Heavenly Hideaway</strong>, a spacious 4-bedroom, 3.5-bath mountain cabin tucked away on 12 private acres at an elevation of 3,200 feet. Surrounded by natural beauty, with three gentle creeks meandering along the property lines, this retreat offers the perfect balance of privacy and easy access to nearby attractions. Whether you're seeking a quiet getaway or a base for adventure, Heavenly Hideaway invites you to slow down, reconnect, and explore.</p>

    <p>The property feels like a hidden paradise. Wander along the creeks, stroll through open meadows and wooded trails, or simply breathe in the fresh mountain air. Wildlife sightings and the calming sound of running water create a setting that feels worlds away from everyday life — yet you're only a short drive from charming towns, hiking trails, rivers, lakes, and more.</p>

    <p>Inside the cabin, comfort and togetherness come naturally. At the heart of the home is a <strong>double-sided fireplace</strong>, offering cozy warmth to both the open-concept living room and a charming adjoining den. Rustic accents, inviting seating, and thoughtful design touches create a welcoming mountain escape perfect for every season. The fully equipped kitchen makes meal preparation easy, whether you're whipping up breakfast before heading out or gathering around the large dining table for hearty family dinners.</p>

    <p>The four bedrooms are thoughtfully arranged to accommodate families, groups of friends, or multiple couples. Heavenly Hideaway offers <strong>two master suites</strong>, each with its own private ensuite bath — perfect for providing extra comfort and privacy. Additional bedrooms ensure everyone has a comfortable space to retreat to. With three full bathrooms and an additional half bath, there's plenty of room for everyone to relax without ever feeling crowded.</p>

    <p>Outside, the adventure continues. Unwind on the spacious deck, grill out under the open sky, or soak in the peaceful surroundings from the bubbling hot tub. Gather around the fire pit at night for stories, laughter, and stargazing. With 12 acres to explore, there's always a secret path to discover or a sunny spot along the creek to sit and enjoy the view.</p>

    <p>Though you’ll feel wonderfully secluded, Heavenly Hideaway’s location puts you just minutes from outdoor adventures and small-town charm. Spend your days hiking scenic trails, kayaking nearby rivers, shopping in local boutiques, or enjoying farm-to-table dining. Adventure and amenities are always close — but only when you want them.</p>

    <p>At Heavenly Hideaway, you don't have to choose between peaceful seclusion and exciting exploration — here, you can have both. Whether you're planning a family gathering, a couples’ retreat, or a quiet weekend to recharge, this mountain sanctuary offers the perfect backdrop for unforgettable memories.</p>

    <p><strong>Book your stay today and experience the magic of Heavenly Hideaway for yourself!</strong></p>
