<h2>⛳ Mountain Aire Golf Club (West Jefferson, NC – ~20 minutes away)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mountainairegolfclub.com/" target="_blank">Mountain Aire</a> is a scenic mountain course featuring dramatic elevation changes, long-range views, and a fair but engaging layout for golfers of all levels. Expect tee boxes with up to 200-foot elevation drops, open fairways, and a relaxed atmosphere just minutes from the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>Owner’s Tip:</strong> Mountain Aire is very accommodating — they’ll even rent an extra cart for non-golfers. My wife and friends often ride along the front nine with drinks in hand, enjoying the views. By hole 10, they usually decide to ride the full 18 — it's like a mountain hike without the walking.</p>

<h2>🏌️‍♂️ Olde Beau Golf Club (Roaring Gap, NC – ~1 hr 15 min away)</h2>
<p><a href="https://oldebeauresort.com/golf/" target="_blank">Olde Beau</a> is a hidden gem nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The course is expertly maintained with lush fairways, gorgeous landscaping, and challenging holes framed by sweeping vistas. As a frequent golfer, I can confidently say it's one of my all-time favorite places to play — and it's surprisingly affordable for what you get.</p>
<p><strong>Owner’s Tip:</strong> Make a day of it — after your round, take the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway route back to the cabin via Deep Gap. It adds to the experience with stunning mountain views and a peaceful drive.</p>
