<h2>🎣 RiverGirl Fishing Co. (Todd, NC – 5 minutes away)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.rivergirlfishing.com/" target="_blank">RiverGirl Fishing Co.</a> is located in the heart of Todd, just minutes from the cabin. They rent tubes, kayaks, and bikes — and their staff makes the process quick and friendly. Their tubing route is calm, scenic, and perfect for hot summer days. This stretch of the New River winds gently through farmland and shaded mountain curves.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> In spring or fall when the water is cold, choose a kayak to stay dry and still enjoy the float.</p>

<h2>🛶 Zaloo’s Canoes, Kayaks &amp; Tubes (Jefferson, NC – ~20 minutes away)</h2>
<p><a href="https://zaloos.com/" target="_blank">Zaloo’s</a> offers a different experience along a wider, deeper stretch of the New River. Their float route has fewer rocks, broader views, and is perfect when water levels are low. Great for second-day floats or those looking for something more open and sunny.</p>

<h2>💡 Owner’s Helpful Hint: DIY Tubing</h2>
<p>If you’d rather float on your own time, pick up cheap inner tubes and a 12V car pump at Walmart in West Jefferson. Launch from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/q26F8Zb8WqG2" target="_blank">Green Valley Park</a> and float 1.5–2 hours back into Todd. Use a two-car system (one at the park, one at the pickup spot) and you can float as many times as you want. This DIY approach is scenic, peaceful, and a favorite among returning guests.</p>
